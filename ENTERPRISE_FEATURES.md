# Enterprise Scrum Features - Implementation Complete

## All 10 Features Implemented (Internal Only)

### Part 1: AI & Contextual Automation

#### 1. AI Proactive Scheduling (INTERNAL) ✅
**Implementation:**
- New field: `suggested_focus_time` (datetime)
- Calculation: Based on `due_date` and `effort_tag`
  - Small = 1 hour before due date
  - Medium = 3 hours before due date
  - Large = 6 hours before due date
- Purely internal suggestion, no external calendar integration

**Usage:**
- System automatically calculates suggested focus time when task is created
- Displayed in task details for user planning
- Helps users schedule work blocks internally

#### 2. Contextual Risk Detection ✅
**Implementation:**
- New fields: `is_potential_risk` (boolean), `risk_reason` (text)
- Enhanced Gemini prompt to detect risk language:
  - "waiting for", "depends on", "blocked by"
  - "need approval", "external dependency"
- Flagged in Daily Briefing for admin visibility

**Usage:**
- AI automatically detects risks during transcript processing
- Risks highlighted in briefing dashboard
- Proactive intervention before blockers occur

#### 3. Manual Natural Language Capture (INTERNAL) ✅
**Implementation:**
- New endpoint: `POST /tasks/capture`
- Accepts plain text string
- Gemini extracts: `description` and `assignee`
- Creates task with status: "Capture Inbox"

**Usage:**
```
User types: "Need to review API docs by Friday"
AI extracts: {description: "Review API docs", assignee: "unassigned"}
Task created in Capture Inbox for later planning
```

**Frontend:**
- QuickCapture component in user dashboard
- CaptureInbox component in admin dashboard
- Simple textarea for quick idea capture

#### 4. Confidence-Based Priority ✅
**Implementation:**
- New field: `needs_priority_review` (boolean)
- Logic: If `confidence < 0.7`:
  - Set `priority = 4` (Low)
  - Set `needs_priority_review = True`
- Admin can review and adjust in Review Queue

**Usage:**
- Low-confidence tasks automatically deprioritized
- Flagged for human review
- Prevents incorrect high-priority assignments

### Part 2: Executive Control & Workflow

#### 5. No-Code Approval Workflows ✅
**Implementation:**
- New status: "Manager Approval Pending"
- Rule check: If `story_points > 8` OR `effort_tag == 'large'`
- Task requires manager approval before moving to "To Do"
- New endpoint: `POST /tasks/{id}/approve-manager`

**Usage:**
- Large/complex tasks automatically flagged
- Manager reviews and approves
- Ensures oversight on high-impact work

#### 6. Custom SLA Tracking ✅
**Implementation:**
- New fields:
  - `verification_deadline_at` (24 hours after submission)
  - `sla_breached` (boolean flag)
- Background check: `GET /tasks/sla-breached`
- Automatic notification on breach

**Usage:**
- Task submitted → 24-hour SLA starts
- If not verified in 24 hours → SLA breach flagged
- Notification sent to assignee
- Admin sees breached tasks in dashboard

#### 7. User Group Management ✅
**Implementation:**
- New tables: `teams`, `team_members`
- New field: `team_id` on tasks
- Access control: Users can only view tasks/bundles for their team
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /teams` - Create team
  - `POST /teams/{id}/members/{user_id}` - Add member

**Usage:**
- Admin creates teams (e.g., "Frontend", "Backend")
- Assigns users to teams
- Tasks associated with teams
- Team-based access control

#### 8. Real-Time Status Notifications (INTERNAL LOGGING) ✅
**Implementation:**
- New table: `notifications`
- Fields: `user_id`, `message`, `task_id`, `is_read`, `created_at`
- Events logged:
  - Task submitted
  - Task approved
  - Task rejected
  - SLA breach
  - Manager approval
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /notifications` - List user notifications
  - `PATCH /notifications/{id}/read` - Mark as read

**Usage:**
- All critical events logged to database
- User sees notifications in dashboard
- No external email/Slack (internal only)
- 30-second auto-refresh

### Part 3: Scrum & Calendar UI

#### 9. Daily Shutdown Ritual ✅
**Implementation:**
- Component: `DailyShutdownModal.jsx`
- Triggers at 5:00 PM local time
- Shows incomplete tasks (progress < 100%)
- Button: "Plan for Tomorrow"
- Endpoint: `POST /tasks/plan-tomorrow`
- Action: Changes status to "Planned for Tomorrow" and updates due_date

**Usage:**
- Modal appears automatically at 5 PM
- User reviews incomplete work
- One-click to plan all for tomorrow
- Helps with daily closure routine

#### 10. Time Blocking on Calendar (INTERNAL) ✅
**Implementation:**
- Component: `TaskCalendar.jsx` (already exists)
- Monthly view with tasks on due dates
- Click date to see tasks
- Drag-and-drop (future enhancement)
- Updates `due_date` and status to "Doing"
- Purely internal visualization

**Usage:**
- User sees tasks distributed across month
- Can click dates to view/edit tasks
- Visual workload planning
- No external calendar sync

Manager: Reviews and approves
Status: Changes to "To Do"
```

### 4. SLA Tracking
```
User: Submits task at 2:00 PM Monday
System: Sets verification_deadline_at = 2:00 PM Tuesday
Admin: Doesn't verify by deadline
System: Flags sla_breached = True, sends notification
```

### 5. Daily Shutdown
```
Time: 5:00 PM
Modal: Shows 5 incomplete tasks
