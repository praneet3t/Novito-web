# Enterprise Scrum Features

## Professional Task Management System

### 1. Task Submission & Verification Workflow

**User Workflow:**
1. Work on task and update progress (0-100%)
2. When complete (100%), click "Submit for Review"
3. Provide submission details:
   - **Submission Notes**: Describe what was completed, testing done, implementation details
   - **Link to Work**: GitHub PR, document link, demo URL, design files, etc.
4. Task status changes to "Submitted" and awaits admin verification

**Admin Verification:**
1. View all submitted tasks in "Verification Queue"
2. Review submission notes and linked work
3. Approve or Reject with optional feedback
4. **If Approved**: Task marked "Done" and verified
5. **If Rejected**: Task returns to "Doing" status with feedback for revision

**Flexible Submission Types:**
- **Code Tasks**: GitHub/GitLab PR links
- **Design Tasks**: Figma, Adobe XD, or Drive links
- **Documentation**: Google Docs, Confluence, Notion links
- **Research**: Report documents or presentation links
- **Testing**: Test reports, bug tracking links
- **Deployment**: Deployment logs, environment URLs

### 2. Sprint Board (Kanban View)

**Visual Workflow:**

### 5. Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done

**Quality Standards:**
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements for task completion

- Set by admin during task creation/review
- Visible to assignee for clarity
- Used in verification process

**Example Acceptance Criteria:**
```
- User can login with email/password
- Password validation shows error messages
- Successful login redirects to dashboard
- Failed login shows error notification
- Session persists for 7 days
```

**Example Definition of Done:**
```
- Code reviewed and approved
- Unit tests written and passing
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Deployed to staging environment
- QA sign-off received
```

### 6. Blocker Management

**Blocker Workflow:**
1. User encounters blocker
2. Click "Report Blocker"
3. Describe issue in detail
4. Task flagged as blocked
5. Appears in admin briefing immediately
6. Admin can intervene and resolve

**Common Blockers:**
- Waiting for dependencies

- **P5-7**: Medium priority
- **P1-4**: Low priority

**Priority Queue:**
- Tasks sorted by priority
- Approved tasks only
- Clear work order
- Focus on high-impact items

### 9. Daily Briefing Dashboard

**Executive Insights:**
- Tasks completed today
- Blocked tasks count
- Overdue items
- Top priorities
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

**Productivity Analytics:**

- 7/14/30-day trends
- Smart alerts for issues

### 10. Work Cycles (Sprints)

**Sprint Management:**
- Create cycles with start/end dates
- Set sprint goals
- Assign tasks to sprint
- Track progress snapshots
- View burndown metrics

**Sprint Metrics:**
- Total items vs completed
- Total effort vs remaining
- Blocker count
- Tasks in progress
- Upcoming deadlines
